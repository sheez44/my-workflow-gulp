# my-workflow-gulp

This workflow I use for any projects I build now. Its specifically set-up for frontend developers who need to start out quickly 
without a worry. 

When you type gulp in the command line, it will load up a local server with livereload. 
Any html, sass(css), and javascript will instantly reload the page with the changes.
