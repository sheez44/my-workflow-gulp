# my-workflow-gulp

I use this workflow for any projects I will build from now on. Its specifically set-up for frontend developers who need to start out quickly 
without a worry. 

When you type gulp in the command line, it will load up a local server with livereload. 
Any html, sass(css), and javascript will instantly reload the page with the changes.

The developer side is completely finished, but I am already working on the production side of it.
